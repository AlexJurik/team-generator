# Advanced Team Generator

A JavaScript application that allows you to load an Excel file containing player information, create checkboxes for each player, and generate teams based on player coefficients.

## Problem solved

As an amateur football player, I often play in tournaments with friends. We have to create teams from players who joined tournament and often it takes time to select captains and generate teams. Also this can lead to unbalanced teams and unfair games.

## Features

- Load Excel File: Upload an Excel file with player data. You can download and edit provided sample file.

- Player Selection: For each player in the Excel file, checkboxes are generated. Select players who will play.

- Generate Teams: Enter the number of teams to generate, and the application will create teams based on player coefficients.

- You can randomize teams by clicking "Randomize" button.
