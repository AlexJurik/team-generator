# Advanced Team Generator

A JavaScript application that allows you to enter player manually or by importing Excel file and generate balanced teams based on player coefficients.

## Problem solved

As an amateur football player, I often play in tournaments with friends. We have to create teams from players who joined tournament and often it takes time to select captains and generate teams. Also this can lead to unbalanced teams and unfair games.

## Features

- Add players manually by filling out inputs in the table.

- Import Excel File: Upload an Excel file with player data. You can download and edit provided sample file.

- Generate Teams: Enter the number of teams to generate, and the application will create teams based on player coefficients.

- You can randomize teams by clicking "Randomize" button.

- Players are saved in the local storage, so they are not lost when page refreshes.
